Coding projects and practice

These are all projects done while learning Frontend Development (mostly HTML, CSS, & Javascript) through various sites.
Sites include CodeCademy, Coursera, & FreeCodeCamp.


Since Github doesn't just let you preview HTML files on here, (you have to put them on Git Pages or host them elsewhere), I'm adding preview links for some of my previous projects. These will be previewed through Raw.Githack.com. This, unfortunately, won't preview the functional games. I'll work on hosting those elsewhere and add links when I can.
